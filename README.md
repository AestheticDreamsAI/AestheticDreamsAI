## Real Solutions
Stuff that works ‚Äî no committee process, just results.

## How I Work
**Solo Delivery**  
I handle architecture, build, and handover.  
One person. Full responsibility.

**Independent Infrastructure**  
My tools, my servers, my process.  
Your project doesn‚Äôt depend on corporate policies.

**Direct Communication**  
Async. Clear. No status-meeting circus.  
Updates only when they matter.

**Action Over Analysis**  
Build, test, iterate, deliver.  
No analysis paralysis.

**Project-Based Pricing**  
Scope ‚Ä¢ timeline ‚Ä¢ price ‚Äî agreed upfront.  
Predictable costs. Guaranteed delivery.

**Full Ownership**  
All code, docs, and assets are yours.  
No lock-in. Your control.

**Best Fit**  
- Decision makers who value results over process  
- Teams ready to move fast  
- Projects needing independent, reliable solutions  
- Businesses that know quality has a price

**Not a fit if** you need committees, ‚Äúenterprise beautiful,‚Äù constant validation, or cheap everything.
