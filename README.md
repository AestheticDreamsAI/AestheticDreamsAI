# üëã Phil Frei  
## 37, wheelchair, zero fucks given. I build AI that actually works.

### üî• The Real Deal  
I'm not your typical developer story. Been coding AI since 2003 - before it was cool, before everyone was an "AI expert." While others talked about what's possible, I built it. 

**What I'm about:** Privacy-first AI, local processing, automated content creation. Your data stays yours, your AI works offline, your tools respect your autonomy.

### üöÄ What I'm Building Right Now  

**[GoogolPlex 2025](https://github.com/AestheticDreamsAI/googolplex-2025)** ‚Äì Remember the legendary 2014 iOS Siri hack? I rebuilt it. Better, open-source, Python plugins, completely local.

**[Alessia Seelentanz](https://alessia-seelentanz.de/)** ‚Äì Fully automated AI influencer. She writes her own content, posts consistently, has a real personality. [Instagram: @alessiaseelentanz](https://www.instagram.com/alessiaseelentanz/). Still figuring out the viral SEO stuff, but she's running.

**[Luxa Voice Suite](https://github.com/AestheticDreamsAI/Luxa)** ‚Äì Home Assistant gets actually smart with local AI voice integration. Python & C# versions because I like options.

### üí° Currently Exploring  
- Making AI influencers go viral (SEO optimization is a work in progress)
- Local-first everything (screw the cloud surveillance)  
- Voice AI that doesn't phone home to Big Tech
- Content automation that creates authentic stuff, not generic spam

---

### ü§ù Let's Collaborate  
Building something ambitious? Something that seems impossible? Something privacy-focused that Big Tech won't touch? 

**I'm interested.**

### ‚ö° The Origin Story  
Built my first AI prototype at 17 - a simple pattern recognition system that could barely work. It was crude, but it sparked something. 20+ years later, that curiosity never stopped.

Had to fight through kidney transplants, hip surgeries, strokes, and everyone telling me what I'd never achieve. Taught myself everything - programming, AI, web design. No degrees, no bootcamps, just raw determination and a "screw you, I'll prove it" attitude.
