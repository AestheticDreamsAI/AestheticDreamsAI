ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Phil Frei, a tech geek obsessed with programming, design, and A.I.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in pushing the boundaries of technology and exploring innovative solutions in software development and artificial intelligence.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced machine learning algorithms and how to integrate them into practical applications.

ðŸ’– Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to A.I., software development, and open-source initiatives that make a real-world impact.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to reach out via drop me an email at info@aestheticdreams.net.

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym or tinkering with DIY projects. I love staying active and creating something new every day!
