# üëã Phil Frei  
## 37, wheelchair. Independent builder. I create AI that works ‚Äì local, private, patch-proof.

### üî• The Approach  
Not the usual developer story. Started coding AI in 2012 ‚Äì before it was trendy, before ‚ÄúAI experts‚Äù were everywhere. While others talked, I built.  

**What I stand for:**  
- Independence first.  
- Privacy-first AI, always local.  
- Systems that survive updates.  
- Function over form.  

No hype. No noise. Just solutions that work.

### ‚ö° Story  
Built my first AI in 2012. Crude, but it worked.  
Since then: surgeries, transplants, strokes. Reasons to stop ‚Äì but I didn‚Äôt.  

No degree. No shortcuts. Just persistence and building.  

> **‚ÄúNobody believed in me ‚Äì but I did.‚Äù**
