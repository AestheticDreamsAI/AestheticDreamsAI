# üëã Phil Frei  
## 37, wheelchair, zero fucks given. I build AI that actually works ‚Äì local, private, and patch-proof.

### üî• The Real Deal  
I'm not your typical developer story. Been coding AI since 2003 ‚Äì before it was cool, before everyone was an "AI expert." While others talked about what's possible, I built it. No hype, no bullshit.  

**What I'm about:** Independence first. Privacy-first AI, local processing, automated content creation. Your data stays yours, your AI works offline, your tools respect your autonomy. I care about privacy, but I don‚Äôt make mountains out of molehills ‚Äì it‚Äôs about real solutions, not drama.

### üöÄ What I'm Building Right Now  

**[GoogolPlex 2025](https://github.com/AestheticDreamsAI/googolplex-2025)** ‚Äì A patch-proof, local Siri plugin framework for iOS ‚Äî inspired by the GoogolPlex (Betterthansiri.com) hack (2014), but open, extensible and privacy-first. Built with Python. Outcome: Patch-proof iOS extension, privacy-first control.

**[Alessia Seelentanz](https://alessia-seelentanz.de/)** ‚Äì Fully automated AI influencer with real voice and emotional intelligence. She writes her own poetic content, posts consistently, has a real personality, long-term memory, learns from the past, and evolves automatically. Experimental: Possesses emotional intelligence, long-term memory, learns from the past and develops itself further. [Instagram: @alessiaseelentanz](https://www.instagram.com/alessiaseelentanz/). Still figuring out the viral SEO stuff, but she's running locally, no cloud bullshit.

**[LAMBot-AI](https://github.com/AestheticDreamsAI/LAMBot-AI)** ‚Äì A simple Language Action Model (LAM) chatbot built with C# and ML.NET that recognizes user intents and executes specific actions such as launching applications. Built with C#. Outcome: Fast intent recognition, app automation.

**[Cherry-Lite](https://github.com/AestheticDreamsAI/Cherry-Lite)** ‚Äì Simple offline AI client based on the LAMBot-AI framework. It recognizes user intents and performs actions like launching applications using machine learning and NLP. Built with C#. Outcome: Offline AI for app control, no internet needed.

**[PiperLing](https://github.com/AestheticDreamsAI/PiperLing)** ‚Äì Powerful open-source interpreter AI based on Piper TTS, Ollama or GPT4o, and C#. Designed to provide simple and fast speech translation and synthesis. Built with C#. Outcome: Offline real-time translation pipelines.

**[PiperLingWebApp](https://github.com/AestheticDreamsAI/PiperLingWebApp)** ‚Äì Simple Web UI for use as a Desktop or Smartphone app with PiperLing. Built with HTML/JavaScript. Outcome: Lightweight web interface for speech AI.

### üí° Currently Exploring  
- Making AI influencers go viral (SEO optimization is a work in progress, but local and independent)  
- Local-first everything (screw the cloud surveillance ‚Äì your shit, your rules)  
- Voice AI that doesn't phone home to Big Tech  
- Content automation that creates authentic stuff, not generic spam ‚Äì with real evolution and no lock-in  

---

### ü§ù Let's Collaborate  
Building something ambitious? Something that seems impossible? Something privacy-focused that Big Tech won't touch?  

**I'm interested ‚Äì but only if it's solo, project-based, and aligns with my standards. No babysitting, no hourly circus.**

### ‚ö° The Origin Story  
Built my first AI prototype at 17 ‚Äì a simple pattern recognition system that could barely work. It was crude, but it sparked something. 20+ years later, that curiosity never stopped.  

Had to fight through kidney transplants, hip surgeries, strokes, and everyone telling me what I'd never achieve. Taught myself everything ‚Äì programming, AI, web design. No degrees, no bootcamps, just raw determination and a "screw you, I'll prove it" attitude. Turned pain into power, because giving up ain't an option.  

**"Nobody believed in me ‚Äì but I did. That's why I made it."**
