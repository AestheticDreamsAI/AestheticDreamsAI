## Independent builder. Function over Form.

37. Wheelchair. Direct approach.  
I design and build systems that **work** â€” end to end, without drama.  
No committees. No hand-holding. Clear scope, clear ownership, clear delivery.

---

## What I Do
- Build real products and internal tools from scratch  
- Automate workflows and connect systems that donâ€™t talk to each other  
- Make things robust, patch-resistant, and easy to operate  
- Keep dependencies low and control high

I use what fits: **C#, Python, JavaScript**, iOS Shortcuts, Home Automation, local services, lightweight infra.  
AI/voice is a tool in the box â€” used when it serves the outcome.

## How I Work
**Solo delivery** â€” one person, full responsibility.  
**Independent** â€” my stack, my process; your control at handover.  
**Direct communication** â€” async, concise, useful updates only.  
**Action over analysis** â€” build â†’ test â†’ iterate â†’ ship.  
**Project pricing** â€” scope, timeline, price agreed upfront.  
**Full ownership** â€” code, docs, assets handed over. No lock-in.

**Best fit**  
- Decision makers who want results over process  
- Teams that move fast and value reliability  
- Projects that need clean integrations and durable systems

**Not a fit** if you want committee cycles, enterprise theater, or discount everything.

## Background
Building since 2012.  
No degree. Learned by shipping.  
Health setbacks, still here, still shipping.  
Function over form â€” always.

**Independence is practical.**  
Fewer dependencies â†’ fewer failures.  
**Build stuff that works.**
